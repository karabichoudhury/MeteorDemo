		<p>“<em>A <u>company</u> is known by the <u>people</u> it keeps</em>”. The statement is so  powerful even in its mixed up form. At RakSan, we have built a great team and  the statement holds “good” for us both ways.</p>
		<p>Organizations  tend to develop their own ambience and culture. At RakSan, we hold  accountability, value based results, meritocracy, customer focus and social  responsibility to our heart. </p>
		<p>Our  longstanding customer account base is not because of budgetary reductions or  “low cost location” benefits but because of strategic depth, excellence and  partnership we offer our clients in all IT engagements.&nbsp; We  are steadfast in our prescription of recommendations in all our engagements  with our clients and have been appreciated for holding fort despite pressures  and resistance. </p>
		<p>We have been valued partner for many  of our clients as they concentrate on their business objectives and rely on our  abilities for all their IT needs, to provide them with right combination of  people, process and technology to strike a balance of financial, technical and  market agility. </p>
		<p>RakSan Consulting has provided software  and services to clients in a wide range of business sectors. We also synergized  our efforts with like-minded partners to provide solutions to businesses in  win-win situations. </p>
		<p>We shall be  posting a few case studies in due course on these pages. If you are interested  in learning how we have been able to add value to our clients and partners  please drop a line on <a href="mailto:valueaddition@raksanconsulting.com">valueaddition@raksanconsulting.com</a> </p>
